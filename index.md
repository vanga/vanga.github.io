Hello ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹,

I am a Software Engineer by profession with mostly experience in Backend development and DevOps, and a rookie Frontend and Machine learning engineer. Well, you get it, I am a generalist.

I have been exploring and collecting public datasets recently
* [Indian Supreme court judgments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vangap/indian-supreme-court-judgments)
* [Dataset of LokSabha 2019 Candidates including financial assets, tax and criminal history](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vangap/loksabha-2019-candidate-details)

I have also been contributing to [Code-Pile](https://github.com/CarperAI/Code-Pile/), an OSS project to build a large dataset for training models like Codex.

(That's it, I have finally set up my personal website)
